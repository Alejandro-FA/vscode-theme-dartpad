## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2022-10-16
### Added
- Changelog.
- MIT License.

### Changed
- Docstrings (`string.quoted.docstring`) now use the same color as comments (`#909cc3`). Previously used color was the same as strings (`#fa557d`).
- `variable.language` token color changed to `#4fe191` to match DartPad. Language specific settings of this token have been removed.
- Black elements of the UI have been changed to use a slightly brighter color (`#0a0f16`). The goal of this change is to achieve a less "contrasty" feel.

### Fixed
- Fix typos in README.md.
